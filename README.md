# newTC1

This repository presents improved data acquistion code as a replacement for nerdaqII code for DIY TC-1-like seismometers. 

For seismometer construction notes see https://www.boisestate.edu/eslab/building-a-tc1-system/construction-of-the-tc1/

The [nerdaqII code](https://github.com/brianxfury/Low-Cost-Arduino-based-Seismometer-Project/tree/master) is an odd combination of filters that interact to produce a bizarre oscillatory response to an impulse, which takes a couple of minutes to settle. I don't think it was ever tested properly. This code replaces it with an advanced decimating, downsampling antialiasing filter, which however uses the same oversampling and averaging approach to get 16 bits out of a 10 bit ADC. Four sets of 128 raw data samples are averaged and downsampled+antialiased to produce each data point.

I've added a slow DC offset removal filter, with a very slow decay (several minutes) so that the final output is zero-centered. The low pass filter response has been validated by testing to be reasonably flat from about 0.1 Hz to 9 Hz, with quite a sharp drop at 9.4 Hz. 

Output sample rate is 18.8 SPS on an Arduino Uno R3 or other ATmega board with 16 MHz clock.
 
In JamaSeis, select the SEP detector, not the TC1 detector which expects a DC offset of 32768.

# Update 4/25/2025:  
S-wave recording of magnitude 6.3 earthquake near Esmeraldas, Ecuador  
Event: 2025-04-25 11:44:55 (UTC), GPS coords 1.105째N 79.535째W.
Recorded using a DIY TC-1 detector with the posted code, located on west coast U.S. near GPS coordinates 44째N 123째W, **distance to source 6300 km.**
X-axis scale is seconds.

**Comparison with RaspberryShake**

I've recently spent some time experimenting with a RaspberryShake setup, and am very disappointed. I have concluded that Shake is **not an improvement** over DIY TC-1-like seismometers. The extra resolution, much higher bandwidth and sensitivity of the geophone and 24 bit ADC appear to result mostly in additional noise, with reduced signal to noise ratio (SNR). Perhaps the geophone mountings are not satisfactory, as I've seen pictures of them just sitting in plastic boxes. Mine was sitting on the same concrete floor, in a very quiet location, but gives signals with similar SNR to the TC-1.

Below is a screenshot comparing three west coast U.S. stations recording at the time of the 6.3 magnitude event pictured above (4/25/2025 11:45 UTC). The top two seismograms are apparently DIY seismometers: one in Bend, Oregon, the other in Camerillo, California, bottom a RaspberryShake station in Portland, Oregon. It is not hard to see the problem!

If the RaspberryShake data are low pass filtered, (1s in JamaSeis), a signal possibly corresponding to that earthquake becomes visible (yellow highlighting).
